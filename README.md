ChoosingHashFct


How to run the code: 
*.cpp files (Itemcollection.cpp;main.cpp)are the input files that contain the appropriate code for reading a large number of distinct product numbers (7-digit each) and deciding which digit among the seven gives the best balanced storage of the pairs of glasses using hash functions and hash table which can be executed  
using Visual studio with a built in option “Run” from the menu bar. Else, Run the command “gcc” (the C-compiler) followed by the full name of your program in the command prompt. This will compile your source code and create an executable file on your desktop.  
 
 
Steps:  
1.User must provide the detailed inputs for each of the above-mentioned Cpp files.  
2.Code would be then processed for reading the distinct product numbers first followed by deciding the best-balanced storage. 
3. And the output would be printed showing the best hashing function after reading/removing corresponding storage pairs. Snapshot of code executing the two given input files.
